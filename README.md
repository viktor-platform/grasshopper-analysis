# sample-grasshopper-analysis
A VIKTOR sample app which runs a Grasshopper script with Ladybug sunhours analysis. 🦗🐞

This app demonstrates how to connect VIKTOR applications to Grasshopper scripts. The app is connected to a Rhino Grasshopper instance running on a server, and allows the user to run a Grasshopper script with a sunhours analysis. A twisting tower is configured through the app parameters, and each time the user updates a parameter, a Grasshopper script runs on the server that performs a sunhours analysis using the popular Ladybug plugin.
