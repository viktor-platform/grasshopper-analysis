# sample-grasshopper-analysis
A VIKTOR sample app which runs a Grasshopper script with Ladybug sunhours analysis. ü¶óüêû

This app demonstrates how to connect VIKTOR applications to Grasshopper scripts. The app is connected to a Rhino Grasshopper instance running on a server, and allows the user to run a Grasshopper script with a sunhours analysis. A twisting tower is configured through the app parameters, and each time the user updates a parameter, a Grasshopper script runs on the server that performs a sunhours analysis using the popular Ladybug plugin.

The app allows the user to adjust the tower parameters and visualize the resulting geometry and sunhour performance in real-time:

The Grasshopper script and worker configuration used for this app can be found in this repo under `files`.
